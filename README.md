# Secure-Smartphones
This is a document where you can find all the good practices to maintain your phone secure. Securing IoT devices can be a challenging task, but there are several steps you can take to help ensure that your devices are cybersecurity compliant. Here are some tips:
1. Use strong, unique passwords for each device you have: this will help prevent unauthorized access to your devices. 

   -  It is hard to keep track of our data, so I would strongly recommend using a Password Manager so we can keep all of them in one safe place, think about it, isn't it better to remember one super hard password rather than multiple ? 
    
 - Here are the links to password managers: [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/create-account.php).
    
2. Some techniques to have a hard password could be: 3 random words with the first letter as an uppercase and some kind of symbol at the end. 
    - Example: *shoe+last+Chocolate2022*, harder than ~~password~~

3. Keep your devices up to date. Regularly installing updates and patches can prevent and help fix known security vulnerabilites and keep your devices safe.

4. Enable MFA ([Multi-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication))
    - This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (such as code sent to your phone) before granting access to your device.
    - This setting is usually within the apps you are using, look for it and set it up. 

5. Keep your data safe.
    - Don't combine your work data with your personal data.
    - Never share personal data with anyone you don't fully trust. 
    - Check your privacy settings in all of your social media accounts, this usually are on the "settings" menu.
    - If something makes you feel uncomfortable, you should probably not be doing it. 

6. Keep your data even more safe, encrypt it. 
    - There are many different encryption software tools that can be used to encrypt data on smartphones. Some popular options include:
      - Android built-in encryption feature: Available on most Android devices running Android 5.0 or later and can be used to encrypt the device's internal storage.
      - Apple's buil-in encryption feature: This is available on all Iphones running iOS 8 or later and can be used to encrypt the device's internal storage. 
      - Symantec Encryption Desktop: A commercial encryption tool that can be used to encrypt files, folders, and email messages on both Windows and MacOS devices.
      - AxCrypt: a user-friendly encryption tool that can be used to encrypt individual files and folders on both Android and iOS devices.
7. Be cautious when installing apps.
     - Only download apps from trusted sources and be careful about the permissions you grant to apps. 
     - Be EXTREMELY cautious when installing apps on company issued phones. 

8. Use a secure network.
     - Be careful when connections to public (unsecure) Wi-Fi networks, there are vulnerable. Connect to a [VPN](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-vpn-services) when posible.

9. Back-up your data regularly.
     - There are many different smartphone apps that can be used to back up your data. Some popular options are:
